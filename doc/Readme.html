    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    To build the Ve classes and application you need:
    <ul>
        <li>A working OpenGL library</li>
        <li>The GLUT library</li>
        <li>The OpenCV computer vision library.</li>
        <li>The Epix XCLIB frame grabber library. (If you plan to use an Epix
            frame grabber board.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Windows Build Instructions</h1>
    The build process has been tested with Visual Studio .NET (VS 7.1), and
    project files are provided for that version of Visual Studio (won't work
    with earlier versions). Building on windows may require you to build some
    of the libraries from source, a process that may not work as smooth as
    desired.
    <p>
    Some of the settings mentioned below may already be included in the .NET 
    project. They are still mentioned for a complete reference. 
    </p>
    <h2>GLUT library</h2>
    A pre-compiled GLUT library for Windows can be downloaded from 
    <a
href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html">http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html</a>.
    <p>
    To use the GLUT library you need to
    </p>
    <div class="steps">
		<li>
			Put the <span class="code">glut32.dll</span> into the dll search path. 
			(Usually <span class="code">C:\Windows\System32</span> or similiar).
		</li>
		<li>
			Put the GL\ header files directory into include path.
		</li>
    </div>
    <h2>OpenCV library</h2>
    A Windows installer for OpenCV can be downloaded from the OpenCV homepage
    at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/</a>.
    <p>
    Simply run the installer and do the following:
    </p>
    <div class="steps">
		<li>
			Put the OpenCV <span class="code">include</span> directory into the 
			include search path.
		</li>
		<li>
			Put the OpenCV <span class="code">lib</span> directory into the
			library search path
		</li>
		<li>
			Link against <span class="code">cv.lib</span>
		</li>
    </div>
    <h2>Epix XCLIB</h2>
    <p>
    Install the XCLIB files with the installer. Additionally, you need to:
    </p>
    <div class="steps">
		<li>
			Put the XCLIB directory into the include search path.
		</li>
		<li>
			Put the XCLIB directory into the library search path.
		</li>
		<li>
			Link against <span class="code">XCLIBWNT.lib</span> or 
			<span class="code">XCLIBW95.lib</span>, depending on your
			architecture.
		</li>
    </div>
    <h2>Gnu Common C++ library</h2>
    <p>
    The Common C++ source distribution can be downloaded from 
    <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/commonc++/">http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/commonc++/</a>.
    A Visual Studio project file may be included in the distribution. You may 
    also want 
    to install the XML library from 
    <a href="http://xmlsoft.org">http://xmlsoft.org</a> (a Windows binary
    is available from
    <a href="http://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/binaries.html">http://www.zlatkovic.com/projects/libxml/binaries.html</a>)
    and the OpenSSL library (a windows binary should be available from the same 
    location, otherwise get the sources from
    <a href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the moment you may try to configure the Common C++ libraries to compile
    without XML support, but it may be needed for future versions of ve.
    </p>
    <div class="steps">
		<li>
			Put the Common CC++ <span class="code">include</span> directory
			into the include search path.
		</li>
		<li>
			Put the directory containing the <span class="code">*.lib</span>
			files into the library search path.
		</li>
		<li>
			Put the <span class="code">*.dll</span> files into the system search
			path.
		</li>
		<li>
			Link against <span class="code">ccgnu2.lib</span>
		</li>
    </div>
